    This database is intended to keep track of multiple bands, and the tours they have been on.
    A band can have a singer, bassist, and drummer. They can also have multiple guitarists, which is
    another table so that the bands can contain multiple.

    You can also view Tours by name, which, when clicked, will return to you the headlining band of the tour, the start
    and end year, start and end month, the name of the tour, and the countries it visited.

    Guitarists can be viewed separately as well.
